      <h1 class="blue ">WEB ðŸ’» DEVELOPMENT </h1>
     <p > 
      Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
      <p class="italic">Front-end development</p>
      Front-end development is the process of designing and implementing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a web application. It involves creating visually appealing and interactive elements that users interact with directly. The primary technologies and concepts associated with front-end development include:
      
      <p class="sub-italic"> Technologies</p>
      The 3 core technologies for front- end development are-
     
        <ul class="hello">
      <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)- 
        HTML provides the structure and organization of content on a webpage.
      </li> <li> CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)- 
        Responsible for styling and layout, 
        CSS enhances the presentation of HTML elements, 
        making the application visually appealing.
      </li><li>JavaScript- It is used to add interactions to the web pages. 
        Advancement in JavaScript has given rise to many popular front- end frameworks like React, Angular and Vue.js etc.
      </li></ul>
        <p class="sub-italic">User interface design</p>
      User experience design focuses on creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable for users. It involves understanding user behavior, conducting usability studies, and implementing design principles to enhance the overall satisfaction of users interacting with a website or application. This involves wireframing, prototyping, and implementing design principles to enhance user interaction. Some of the popular tools used for UI Wireframing are -
      <ul >
           <li> Sketch for detailed, vector-based design
      </li><li> Moqups for beginners
      </li><li> Figma for a free wireframe app
      </li><li> UXPin for handing off design documentation to developers
      </li><li> MockFlow for project organization
      </li><li> Justinmind for interactive wireframes

        </li>
    </ul>
      <p class="sub-italic">Responsive design</p>
      It is important to ensure that web applications are accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes. Responsive design uses CSS media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different viewing environments.
      
      <p class="sub-italic">Front-end frameworks</p>
      A framework is a high-level solution for the reuse of software pieces, a step forward in simple library-based reuse that allows for sharing common functions and generic logic of a domain application.[19]
      
      Frameworks and libraries are essential tools that expedite the development process. These tools enhance developer productivity and contribute to the maintainability of large-scale applications. Some popular front-end frameworks are:
      <ul>
     <li> React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.
     </li><li>Angular: A TypeScript-based front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It provides a comprehensive solution for building dynamic single-page applications.
    </li> <li> Vue.js: A progressive JavaScript framework that is approachable yet powerful, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="sub-italic" >State management</p>
      Managing the state of a web application to ensure data consistency and responsiveness. State management libraries like Redux (for React) or Vuex (for Vue.js) play a crucial role in complex applications.
      
      <p class="italic">Back-end development</p>
      Back-end development involves building the server-side logic and database components of a web application. It is responsible for processing user requests, managing data, and ensuring the overall functionality of the application. Key aspects of back-end development include:
      
      <p class="sub-italic">Server/ cloud instance</p>
      An essential component of the architecture of a web application is a server or cloud instance. A cloud instance is a virtual server instance that can be accessed via the Internet and is created, delivered, and hosted on a public or private cloud. It functions as a physical server that may seamlessly move between various devices with ease or set up several instances on one server. It is therefore very dynamic, scalable, and economical.
      
      <p class="sub-italic">Databases</p>
      Database management is crucial for storing, retrieving, and managing data in web applications. Various database systems, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, play distinct roles in organizing and structuring data. Effective database management ensures the responsiveness and efficiency of data-driven web applications. There are 3 types of databases:
      

      <ul>
        <li>Relational databases: Structured databases that use tables to organize and relate data. Common Examples include - MySQL, PostgreSQL and many more.
        </li><li> databases: NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and can be more flexible than relational databases. They come in various types, such as document-oriented, key-value stores, column-family stores, and graph databases. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, CouchDB, Redis.
        </li><li>Document stores: Document stores store data in a semi-structured format, typically using JSON or XML documents. Each document can have a different structure, providing flexibility. Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.
        </li><li>Key-value stores: Key-value stores store data as pairs of keys and values. They are simple and efficient for certain types of operations, like caching. Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.
        </li><li>Column-family stores: Column-family stores organize data into columns instead of rows, making them suitable for large-scale distributed systems and analytical workloads. Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase.
        </li><li>Graph databases: Graph databases are designed to represent and query data in the form of graphs. They are effective for handling relationships and network-type data. Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.
        </li><li>In-memory databases: In-memory databases store data in the system's main memory (RAM) rather than on disk. This allows for faster data access and retrieval. Examples: Redis, Memcached.
        </li><li>Time-series databases: Time-series databases are optimized for handling time-stamped data, making them suitable for applications that involve tracking changes over time. Examples: InfluxDB, OpenTSDB.
        </li><li>NewSQL databases: NewSQL databases aim to provide the scalability of NoSQL databases while maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) of traditional relational databases. Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB.
        </li><li>Object-oriented databases: Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, which can include both data and methods. They are designed to work seamlessly with object-oriented programming languages. Examples: db4o, ObjectDB.
        </ul>
      <p class="italic">Application programming interface (APIs)</p>
      Application Programming Interfaces are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
      <ul>
      RESTful APIs and GraphQL are common approaches for defining and interacting with web services.
      
      </ul>
      Types of APIs
      <ul>
      <li>Web APIs: These are APIs that are accessible over the internet using standard web protocols such as HTTP. RESTful APIs are a common type of web API.
      </li><li>Library APIs: These APIs provide pre-built functions and procedures that developers can use within their code.
    </li><li>Operating System APIs: These APIs allow applications to interact with the underlying operating system, accessing features like file systems, hardware, and system services.
      
    </li>
      Server-side languages

      Programming languages aimed at server execution, as opposed to client browser execution, are known as server-side languages. These programming languages are used in web development to perform operations including data processing, database interaction, and the creation of dynamic content that is delivered to the client's browser. A key element of server-side programming is server-side scripting, which allows the server to react to client requests in real time.
